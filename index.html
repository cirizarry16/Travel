    <h1>Places I have traveled and want to travel too</h1>

    <p>
	I have been alive for about 20 years now, which I am learning it is not all that 	much and I have a lot of life left to live. I have not done much traveling in my 	life. I was born in San German, Puerto Rico and I lived there for ten years and 		my mom and dad decided to move to Oraldno, FL. I have been living in Orlando now 	for ten more years. In those ten years I have not left Florida very often and if 	I did travel some where it was <em>Puerto Rico</em> to visit family.
    </p>
    <h2>Puerto Rico</h2>
    <p>
	In the ten years I lived in <a href="puertorico/been.html">San German,Puerto 			Rico</a> my family and I drove all over the small island visiting family and 			exploring beutifull places that are all over the island. 
    </p>
    <h2>Venice</h2>
    <p>
	When I think of traveling some where one of the first places to come to mind is 		<a href="venice/havent.html">Venice,Italy</a>. Traveling to <em>Venice</em> is 	one of the things I have in my checklist of places to travel too.
