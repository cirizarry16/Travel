    <h1>Venice,Italy</h1>
    <p>
	Venice, the capital of the Veneto region, has a population of more than 270,000, 	according to the latest census (2004). It is located in the north-east of Italy 	on numerous small islands in the Venetian Lagoon.
    </p>

    <p>
	The "City of Bridges", as it is usually called, stretches along the mouths of 	the Po and the Piave rivers. 
	Out of the 270,000 inhabitants, about 62,000 live in the historical center, or 	city of Venice, about 176,000 live in the mainland or "Terraferma", behind the 	lagoon, in locations like Mestre and Marghera, and all others live on islands 	throughout the lagoon (there are about 100 islands around Venice).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
	Venice never quite seems real, 
	but rather an ornate film set suspended 
	on the water.

	The main means of transportation in Venice is by boat, as the city is surrounded 	by canals (you can find about 150 in Venice), but the city is also easy to visit 	by foot. The causeway built in the 19th century allows trains to reach the city 	of Venice from the mainland.
