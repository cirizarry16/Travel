    <h1>San German,Puerto Rico</h1>
    <p>
	Puerto Rico, officially known as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Estado Libre 			Asociado de Puerto Rico), is an unincorporated territory of the United States, 			located in the northeastern Caribbean, east of the Dominican Republic and west 			of both the U.S. Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands.

	Puerto Rico is only 100 miles long by 35 miles wide, making it the smallest 		island of the Greater Antilles. Puerto Rico (Spanish for "rich port") consists 		of an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and several 		islands: Vieques, Culebra, Mona and numerous islets.

	About 75% of Puerto Rico's land area consists of hills or mountains too steep 	for intensive commercial cultivation. The Cordillera Central range, separating 	the northern coast from the semiarid south, has the island's highest peak, Cerro 	de Punta (4,389 ft-1,338 m). Puerto Rico's best-known peak, El Yunque (3,496 	ft-1,066 m), stands to the east, in the Luquillo Mountains (Sierra de Luquillo). 	The north coast consists of a level strip about 100 mi (160 km) long and 5 mi (8 	km) wide. Principal valleys are located along the east coast, from Fajardo to 	Cape Mala Pascua, and around Caguas, in the east-central region. Offthe eastern 	shore are two small islands: Vieques, with an area of 51 sq mi (132 sq km), and 	Culebra, covering 24 sq mi (62 sq km). Uninhabited Mona Island (19 sq mi-49 sq 	km), off the southwest coast, is a breeding ground for wildlife.
